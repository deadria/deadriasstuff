    <h2> SLAVERY ERA DISCLOSURE LAWS </h2>

    <div style="text-align:left">
        <p>On March 9, 2000, Bill Rigby of Reuters News broke the story.  Deadria Farmer-Paellmann, a 34-year-old lawyer and activist was single-handedly petitioning several U.S. corporations to apologize for their involvement in slavery.</p>

        <p>Aetna Inc. was her first target.  They wrote life insurance policies on the lives of enslaved Africans. Slave owners were the beneficiaries.  The practice made buying captive Africans a safe investment. Deadria demanded that they disgorge their profits from the policies -- pay restitution into a Trust Fund to benefit descendants of enslaved Africans.</p> 

        <p>To aid in Deadria's quest for justice, California Senator Tom Hayden began drafting a bill that required insurance companies to disclose their slavery past. The law passed by October of 2000. Since then, over 13 disclosure laws have passed around the United States.</p>

        <p>These laws have morphed into international legislation with the United Kingdom passing an Anti-Slavery Disclosure Law requiring companies of a certain size to reveal their modern anti-slavery efforts.  The United States is considering similar legislation to fight modern slavery too.</p>

    <p>States or municipalities that passed Slavery Era Disclosure Laws include:</p>

    <ul>
        <li>CALIFORNIA: State, Los Angeles, Oakland, Richmond, Berkeley, San Francisco</li>
        <li>ILLINOIS: State, Chicago</li>
        <li>IOWA: State</li>
        <li>MICHIGAN: Detroit, Wayne</li>
        <li>OHIO: Cleveland</li>
        <li>PENNSYLVANIA: Philadelphia</li>
        <li>WISCONSIN: Milwaukee</li>
    </ul>
